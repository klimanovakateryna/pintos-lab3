/*
  Exercise: Pintos Linked Lists

  test_list demonstrates how to work with linked lists.
  Should be removed from kernel after you play with it!!

  1. Add this code at the end of src/thread.c

  2. Call test_list at the end of thread_start().

  3. Build pintos in src/thread.  cd build.  Run "pintos run alarm-multiple".
     Can you see where test_list is called?

  4. Find the list code (hint: see aliases below) and look at list.h and list.c.

  5. Read list.h, especially the discussion of list_entry.
     On a piece of paper sketch the linked list to show how list_entry works.
     Show this to me.

  6. Finish the for-loop to print out the elements in the list.

  7. In test_list, after printing the list, use list_min to find and
     print the minimum element in your list (probably "Spain").  Hint:
     you can use the strcmp function to implement the less function
     pointer.  Take a look at how this is done in src/tests/internal/list.c
     to get an idea how to write your own value_less function.  Note that
     list_min returns a list node NOT the min item.

  8. You should then return allocated memory in a reasonable manner.
     What happens to the list when memory is freed?

  9. Show me your working solution!!

  10. Finally, remove these and all other changes from src/thread.c when complete.

BTW, here are helpful aliases for your .bashrc
findn: USAGE find filename.  Recursively looks to match filename substring in any file name.
FIND XX : executes a grpe, looking for string XX in all file.
CFIND XX: like FIND, but only considers .c file.

findn(){name \*$1\* -print;}
FIND(){ find . -exec grep -s $1 {} \; -print; }
CFIND(){ find . -name \*.c -exec grep -s $1 {} \; -print; }
